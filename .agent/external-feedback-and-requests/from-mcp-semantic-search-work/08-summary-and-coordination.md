## Implementation Notes

### Iterative Approach

These enhancements can be implemented incrementally:

1. Start with high-priority items (descriptions, ontology)
2. Add examples and extensions to new endpoints as they're developed
3. Backfill existing endpoints during maintenance windows

### Testing Impact

After each schema change:

1. Run `pnpm type-gen` in oak-notion-mcp
2. Verify generated types and tools update correctly
3. Test AI tool discovery in ChatGPT Developer Mode
4. Measure tool selection accuracy improvements

### Cross-Team Coordination

- **API team:** Schema updates, new endpoint implementation
- **Documentation team:** Review descriptions for clarity and consistency
- **AI integration team (oak-notion-mcp):** Validate generated outputs, provide feedback
- **Product team:** Align tool usage guidance with user workflows

## Next Steps

We'd welcome the opportunity to:

1. **Demo the current AI tools** - Show you what's already possible and what becomes possible with these enhancements
2. **Discuss implementation priority** - Especially Items #3 (ontology) and #4 (error docs) which have the biggest impact
3. **Collaborate on metadata patterns** - We can provide draft descriptions/examples for your review
4. **Share success metrics** - Once improvements are live, we'll track and share tool selection accuracy and teacher satisfaction
